# Autocorrected-Speed-Typing-Game
## Status: Completed
In this project, I built a program that measures typing speed and autocorrects misspelled words by users. This project was inspired by [typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com).
Please contact me at: amandip@berkeley.edu to see the code for this repository.
